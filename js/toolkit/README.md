# toolkit folder

The purpose of the toolkit folder is to hold
scripts that provide helper functions to make 
life easier.

Mostly, it is a collection of functions that
have no direct dependencies on the game.

The only dependency it *does* have on the game
is that it will be added to **`game.toolkit`**
to provide easier access.
